![alt text](https://github.com/OofySimpsonV3/wmu/raw/main/preview.gif)

WMU is a Terminal UI written in BASH that allows you to easily send messages to a specific Discord server channel via a Webhook.

WARNING!!! Discord Webhooks are POST-ONLY. This means that there is no way to see any other messages that get sent in the channel.

This script is only made and used for sending messages, not receiving.

## Installation

It is very simple!

- 1. Clone Repos

`git clone https://github.com/OofySimpsonV3/wmu.git`

- 2. Change file permissions 

`cd wmu`

`sudo chmod +x wmu.sh`

- 3. Run!

`./wmu.sh`

or alternatively...

`bash wmu.sh`

## Usage

Once the script is running, you will be prompted to enter a URL.

Paste in your URL and press enter.

You will then be able to send messages! :D
